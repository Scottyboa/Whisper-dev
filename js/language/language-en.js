<strong>Privacy and Data Processing</strong><br><br>
This web app is designed as a tool for speech-to-text and note generation. It is your full responsibility as a healthcare professional/data controller to ensure that all use complies with GDPR, the Health Personnel Act, and the Norwegian “Normen” for information security.<br><br>

You alone are responsible for ensuring that the use of this app meets all requirements under:<br>
- GDPR<br>
- The Health Personnel Act<br>
- The Norwegian Information Security Norm (“Normen”)<br><br>

This includes, among other things:<br>
- Entering necessary agreements (DPAs)<br>
- Performing thorough risk assessments (DPIA and TIA)<br><br>

– More information about this is found further down in this text.<br><br>

The developer of this web app assumes no responsibility for your use or lack of compliance. This is not legal advice; you must involve a data protection officer/legal advisor as needed.<br><br>

<hr><br>

<strong>1. Practical model recommendations in this app</strong><br><br>

This app exposes several different providers and models. Below is a practical, opinionated overview to make model choice easier. You must still do your own legal and technical assessment.<br><br>

<strong>Speech-to-text (STT)</strong><br>
- For raw transcription quality, the strongest STT models in this app are generally OpenAI gpt-4o-transcribe and Soniox.<br>
- For routine use with identifiable patient data, Soniox with an EU endpoint and zero data retention is the best aligned with strict GDPR and health-sector requirements. OpenAI typically uses global endpoints with temporary retention and will often end up in a legal “gray zone” unless you have special contracts and EU data residency explicitly in place.<br><br>

<strong>Note generation</strong><br>
- The best note-generation quality in this app typically comes from the ChatGPT models (GPT-5.1 / GPT-4o), the Claude models (via AWS Bedrock), and the Gemini models (Gemini 3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro).<br>
- From a GDPR standpoint, the recommended setup in this app is <strong>AWS Bedrock (Claude)</strong>, because it can be configured for strong data-residency controls (EU/EEA regions), zero data retention, and no-training reuse—making it a highly “GDPR-optimized” path for note generation when set up correctly.<br>
- A strong alternative is <strong>Google Vertex AI with Gemini 2.5 Pro</strong> in an EU region. This requires that you set up your own Google Cloud/Vertex project, deploy a backend, and paste the backend URL and secret into the “Google Vertex” fields on the front page.<br>
- For setup guidance related to Google Vertex and AWS Bedrock, click on the "Guide" hyperlink next to the input fields on the front page.<br>

<strong>Other providers in this app</strong><br>
- Lemonfox, Mistral and Deepgram are included mainly for testing/experimentation and possible non-clinical use. For demanding clinical dictation and note generation, their quality is generally lower than Soniox/OpenAI/Gemini, and their GDPR status depends entirely on which endpoints (EU/global) and options (such as Zero Data Retention) you actually have activated with the provider.<br>
- The GPT models from OpenAI, Deepgram’s default/global endpoints, and Gemini 3 used via Google AI Studio typically involve global infrastructure and temporary data retention. These setups are not automatically GDPR-compliant for identifiable patient data and should be treated as “gray zones” unless you have explicit agreements and EU data residency/ZDR documented.<br><br>

<strong>“Most GDPR-optimized” combination in this app</strong><br>
If you use Soniox with an EU endpoint for speech-to-text and Google Vertex AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro in an EU region with zero data retention) for note generation, the technical data flow in this app can be kept inside the EU with zero data retention and no training reuse at provider side.<br><br>

<hr><br>

<strong>2. How does the web app work?</strong><br>
- Records audio through the browser’s recording functionality.<br>
- Processes audio in the browser’s memory (RAM).<br>
- Uploads the audio file via secure HTTPS to the selected speech-to-text provider (e.g., OpenAI, Soniox, Lemonfox, Mistral/Voxtral, Deepgram) using your own API key from that provider.<br>
- Sends the transcription (and any additional prompt/text) to the selected text model (e.g., GPT-5.1, GPT-4o, Gemini 3, Mistral Large, Lemonfox LLM, Gemini 2.5 Pro via Vertex) via their API, also using your own API key or backend URL/secret.<br>
- Your browser receives the draft note directly from the provider through a secure/encrypted connection.<br><br>

Your API keys are stored only temporarily in the browser’s memory (SessionStorage). When you close the app or browser, the keys are deleted. To use the web app again, you must paste the keys again. This provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized access.<br><br>

The web app has no server that stores audio or text; all communication is directly between your browser and the services you choose (or, in the case of Google Vertex, via the backend URL you have configured in your own Google Cloud project).<br><br>

<hr><br>

<strong>3. Your own API keys are required</strong><br>
All communication with the model providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Soniox, Lemonfox, Deepgram, Mistral, etc.) happens directly from your browser using your personal API keys, or via your own Google Cloud backend URL/secret for Vertex.<br><br>

The developer of this web app has no access to your API keys, your backend URL/secret, or the content you send to the providers.<br><br>

<hr><br>

<strong>4. Data Processing Agreements (DPA) with providers</strong><br>
If you will use API services to process personal data (especially patient data), you are advised to enter a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with each provider you actually use, for example:<br>
- OpenAI (speech-to-text and text generation)<br>
- Google (Gemini 3 via Google AI Studio, Gemini 2.5 Pro via Vertex AI)<br>
- Soniox (speech-to-text)<br>
- Deepgram (speech-to-text)<br>
- Mistral (Voxtral for speech-to-text, Mistral Large for text)<br>
- Lemonfox (Whisper v3 speech-to-text and Llama 3-based text models)<br><br>

OpenAI provides a standard DPA and an organization profile where company information is registered. Equivalent agreements and documents exist for other providers.<br><br>

Once DPAs are in place, you/your organization are the data controller, while the providers (OpenAI, Google, Soniox, Mistral, Deepgram, Lemonfox, etc.) are data processors. You must verify that the agreements adequately cover your specific use (healthcare, research, etc.).<br><br>

<hr><br>

<strong>5. DPIA and TIA – required risk assessments</strong><br><br>

<strong>DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment)</strong><br>
Required under GDPR Article 35 when new technology is used to process special-category data (such as health data). The purpose is to identify and reduce privacy risks related to the processing.<br><br>

You should, among other things:<br>
- Map which data are processed (audio, text, metadata).<br>
- Describe purpose (clinical documentation, quality, research, etc.).<br>
- Assess risks to patients’ rights and freedoms.<br>
- Decide on technical and organizational measures (encryption, access control, logging, training, etc.).<br><br>

<strong>TIA (Transfer Impact Assessment)</strong><br>
Required when personal data is transferred outside the EEA (e.g., to the USA). The purpose is to document that the transfer still provides a “essentially equivalent” level of protection (Schrems II, GDPR Art. 44–49).<br><br>

You should, among other things:<br>
- Assess relevant laws in the recipient country (e.g., FISA 702, CLOUD Act).<br>
- Compare this with the sensitivity of the data and the technical/contractual measures used (encryption, pseudonymization, SCC, ZDR, EU endpoints, etc.).<br>
- Conclude whether the transfer is acceptable and whether the residual risk is tolerable.<br><br>

Both DPIA and TIA should be completed, documented, and approved before using the web app with real patient data.<br><br>

<hr><br>

<strong>6. Data processing, storage, and “GDPR-friendliness” of different providers</strong><br><br>

Below is a rough overview of how services typically operate today. This may change. You must always check current documentation and agreements from each provider.<br><br>

<strong>Lemonfox (speech-to-text and text generation)</strong><br>
EU-based and markets itself as fully GDPR-compliant.<br>
Speech-to-text (Whisper v3) and Llama 3-based text models are processed in the EU, and they state that audio/text is deleted shortly after processing (no training reuse).<br>
This makes Lemonfox relatively GDPR-friendly for both speech-to-text and text generation, provided you still perform DPIA/TIA and have proper agreements.<br><br>

<strong>Soniox (with EU endpoint)</strong><br>
Soniox offers data residency in both the US and EU.<br>
When a project is configured for the EU region, audio and transcripts are processed within that region; some system data (account/billing data) may still be handled globally.<br>
To use the EU endpoint clinically, you typically must contact Soniox and request EU-project access/API key and documentation. Access may take 1–2 days after contact.<br>
With the EU endpoint enabled, Soniox is a strong GDPR-aligned option for speech-to-text, though DPIA/TIA and DPAs remain required.<br><br>

<strong>Mistral (Voxtral for speech-to-text, Mistral Large for text)</strong><br>
EU-based. API data hosting in the EU by default unless explicitly using US endpoints.<br>
Mistral offers Zero Data Retention (ZDR) on request, meaning data is not retained beyond what is necessary to deliver the response. This may simplify GDPR justification but must be documented in DPIA/TIA.<br>
EU endpoint + ZDR (when granted and configured) makes Mistral one of the most GDPR-friendly options in this app.<br><br>

<strong>Google Vertex AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro via EU backend)</strong><br>
In this app, Google Vertex AI is used only through your own backend URL and secret, entered under “Google Vertex” on the front page.<br>
When your Vertex project is configured to use an EU region (for example europe-west1) and zero data retention/no training reuse, prompts and notes are processed within the EU, and request data is not kept longer than necessary to deliver the response, according to Google’s documentation.<br>
This setup can therefore be used as a fully EU-resident, zero-retention alternative for note generation, provided that you also have a valid DPA with Google and have completed DPIA/TIA that explicitly cover this use.<br>
For a practical walk-through of how to create the project, set the region, and deploy the backend used by this app, you can click the guide button in the “Google Vertex” header on the front page; this opens a dedicated ChatGPT guide where you can ask follow-up questions.<br><br>

<strong>Gemini 3 (Google AI Studio)</strong><br>
Gemini 3 used via Google AI Studio / Gemini API with a plain API key is normally processed on Google’s global infrastructure, which may involve transfers outside the EEA.<br>
Google may retain request data for a limited period for abuse detection, reliability and improvement, depending on your settings and agreement, and the endpoint is not by default explicitly EU-locked.<br>
Use of Gemini 3 via Google AI Studio will therefore often be a legal “gray zone” for identifiable patient data unless you have explicit contractual guarantees for EU data residency and retention, documented in your DPIA/TIA.<br><br>

<strong>OpenAI</strong><br>
OpenAI states that API data is not used for training by default, but may be stored temporarily (typically up to ~30 days) for abuse detection and debugging.<br>
OpenAI has introduced data residency in Europe for certain API customers and products, but this requires specific agreements/configurations.<br>
With typical usage in this app, OpenAI calls often go to global (US) endpoints, meaning transfers outside the EEA.<br><br>

Using OpenAI with patient data is often a legal gray zone unless you have:<br>
- a clear DPA,<br>
- documented DPIA/TIA covering the transfer,<br>
- any special arrangements for EU data residency/ZDR if available and activated.<br><br>

<strong>Deepgram (Nova-3)</strong><br>
Historically used global endpoints, but now offers dedicated and EU-specific endpoints.<br>
Using only the default/global endpoint typically means audio is processed outside the EEA.<br>
Deepgram also offers EU-hosted services and various compliance setups, but you must configure the correct endpoint (e.g., api.eu.deepgram.com) and have agreements covering data residency and retention.<br>
As commonly used today, Deepgram—like OpenAI—may involve data transfers outside the EU unless explicitly configured otherwise.<br><br>

<strong>Summary of model options in this app:</strong><br><br>

Most GDPR-optimized path in this app (when correctly configured and with DPA + DPIA/TIA in place):<br>
- Soniox with EU endpoint for speech-to-text.<br>
- Google Vertex AI with Gemini 2.5 Pro in an EU region and zero data retention for note generation.<br><br>

Other relatively GDPR-friendly options (again assuming EU endpoints and any ZDR options are actually enabled and documented):<br>
- Lemonfox (EU STT + LLM, rapid deletion).<br>
- Mistral (Voxtral + Mistral Large) with EU hosting and optional ZDR.<br><br>

More demanding/“gray zones” for patient data (without special agreements/EU residency/ZDR):<br>
- OpenAI via global endpoints.<br>
- Deepgram via global endpoints.<br>
- Gemini 3 via global Google AI Studio/Gemini API without explicit EU lock.<br><br>

In all cases, you/your organization must document compliance with GDPR, the Health Personnel Act, and the Norwegian Information Security Norm.<br><br>

<hr><br>

<strong>7. Preconditions for possible clinical use</strong><br>
Your assessment is decisive: The legality of using this tool with patient data depends entirely on your own thorough assessment of both the app and every provider you connect to (OpenAI, Gemini, Soniox, Lemonfox, Mistral, Deepgram, etc.).<br><br>

Minimum requirements before using patient data:<br>
- Valid DPAs with every provider you use.<br>
- Organization-specific DPIA and TIA that are completed, approved, and conclude acceptable residual risk.<br>
- Clear decision on which models/endpoints may be used for patient data (for example, limiting patient-related use to Soniox with EU endpoint and Google Vertex AI with Gemini 2.5 Pro in an EU region and zero data retention, and possibly Lemonfox/Mistral if your assessments deem them adequate).<br>
- Responsibility for content: You are responsible for all data sent via your API keys/backends and for verifying the generated note before placing it in a patient record.<br><br>

<hr><br>

<strong>8. Overview of data storage</strong><br><br>

(This describes how the web app handles data; provider-side storage must be verified with each provider.)<br><br>

<strong>Your API keys (OpenAI, Soniox, Gemini, Lemonfox, Deepgram, Mistral, etc.) and Vertex backend credentials</strong><br>
- Where stored? SessionStorage in your browser.<br>
- For how long? Until you close the app or browser.<br>
- Who has access? Only you and your browser.<br><br>

<strong>Audio segments during recording</strong><br>
- Where stored? Browser memory (RAM).<br>
- For how long? Only during recording/processing. The app does not store audio permanently.<br>
- Who has access? Only you and your browser before the audio is sent to the selected STT API.<br><br>

<strong>Transcribed text/note drafts at providers</strong><br>
- Where stored? At the selected provider (OpenAI, Google, Soniox, Lemonfox, Mistral, Deepgram, etc.) in their cloud infrastructure, or in your own Google Cloud project when using your Vertex backend.<br>
- For how long? Varies—e.g., OpenAI states data may be stored up to ~30 days for abuse detection; some EU providers (Lemonfox/Mistral with ZDR, Soniox EU, Vertex with zero data retention) delete faster. You must verify each provider’s policy and your own Vertex configuration.<br>
- Who has access? You through the API/backend response, and the provider (or your own Google Cloud project) during the technical retention period.<br><br>

<strong>Instructions/Prompts inside the web app</strong><br>
- Where stored? Locally in your browser (LocalStorage/SessionStorage). If you use the same browser, PC, and API keys/backend values, prompts remain available next time.<br>
- For how long? Until you delete them or clear browser data.<br>
- Who has access? You and your browser.<br><br>

  guideModalHeading: "API key - How to Get",
guideModalText: `How to obtain API keys:<br><br>
To use the speech-to-text and note-generation models in this app, you must obtain one or more API keys (OpenAI, Soniox, Google Gemini, Lemonfox, Deepgram, Mistral).<br><br>

<strong>Speech-to-text models in the app:</strong><br>
- OpenAI: gpt-4o-transcribe<br>
- Soniox<br>
- Soniox (speaker labels)<br>
- Lemonfox Speech-to-Text (Whisper v3-based)<br>
- Voxtral Mini<br>
- Deepgram Nova-3<br><br>

<strong>Text generation models in the app:</strong><br>
- GPT-5.2<br>
- GPT-5.1<br>
- GPT-4-latest<br>
- Claude sonnet 4, 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5(via AWS Bedrock)<br>
- Gemini 2.5 pro(via Google Vertex)<br>
- Lemonfox text generation (Llama 3-based models)<br>
- Mistral Large<br>
- Gemini 3<br><br>

"<strong>Recommended use with regard to GDPR:</strong><br>
- Of the available models in this web app, Soniox (speech-to-text), Google Vertex (Gemini 2.5 Pro), and AWS Bedrock (Claude) will be GDPR-compliant.<br>
- The other models may involve data processing outside the EU’s borders and temporary data retention, which makes them unfavorable for use in a clinical setting with regard to GDPR and the Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s standard.<br>
- For use of this app in a clinical setting, it is therefore strongly recommended to use Soniox for speech-to-text, and Google Vertex and AWS Bedrock for note generation. Fortunately, these models are also very good and will provide high quality for both transcription and note generation.<br><br>"

  <p><strong>3. What are tokens – and how much does 1 consultation cost?</strong></p>

  <p>Models count text in tokens, not plain words.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 token ≈ 4 characters ≈ ¾ of a word</li>
    <li>100 tokens ≈ 75 words</li>
    <li>1,000 tokens ≈ 750 words</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A 15-minute consultation typically:<br>
    2,200 input tokens per 15-minute consultation (the full transcription + structured text sent in),<br>
    450 output tokens in the finished note,<br>
    total approx. 2,650 tokens per consultation.<br><br>
    This means 1 million tokens gives about 350–400 consultations in this usage
    (depending on length and detail).

  <p><em>Some typical combinations for one 15-minute consultation:</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>OpenAI (gpt-4o-transcribe) + GPT-5.1<br>
      ≈ 1.00 NOK (STT) + 0.08 NOK (note) ≈ 1.10 NOK per consultation
    </li>
    <li>Soniox + GPT-5.1<br>
      ≈ 0.30 NOK (STT) + 0.08 NOK (note) ≈ 0.40 NOK per consultation
    </li>
    <li>Voxtral + Mistral Large<br>
      ≈ 0.17 NOK (STT) + 0.08 NOK (note) ≈ 0.25 NOK per consultation
    </li>
    <li>Soniox + Claude Sonnet 4 / 4.5<br>
      ≈ 0.30 NOK (STT) + 0.15 NOK (note) ≈ 0.45 NOK per consultation
    </li>
    <li>Soniox + Claude Haiku 4.5<br>
      ≈ 0.30 NOK (STT) + 0.05 NOK (note) ≈ 0.35 NOK per consultation
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In other words: the text model is extremely cheap — the speech-to-text portion dominates the total cost.
  </p>

  <p><strong>5. Example: monthly cost with steady use</strong></p>

  <p>
    Assume:<br>
    20 consultations per day<br>
    4 days per week<br>
    4 weeks per month<br>
    ⇒ approx. 320 consultations per month (≈ 80 hours of audio).
  </p>

  <p>This yields approximately:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>OpenAI gpt-4o-transcribe + GPT-5.1<br>
      ≈ 31 USD ≈ 340 NOK per month
    </li>
    <li>Soniox + GPT-5.1<br>
      ≈ 10 USD ≈ 110 NOK per month
    </li>
    <li>Voxtral + Mistral Large<br>
      ≈ 7 USD ≈ 80 NOK per month
    </li>
    <li>Lemonfox (Whisper v3 + Llama 3)<br>
      ≈ 14 USD ≈ 150 NOK per month
    </li>
    <li>Deepgram Nova-3 + GPT-5.1<br>
      ≈ 23 USD ≈ 250 NOK per month
    </li>
    <li>Soniox + Claude Sonnet 4 / 4.5<br>
      ≈ 12 USD ≈ 130 NOK per month
    </li>
    <li>Soniox + Claude Haiku 4.5<br>
      ≈ 9 USD ≈ 100 NOK per month
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you don’t use the service (vacation, sick leave, parental leave), no fixed costs accrue;
    you only pay for actual usage with each provider.

guideText: `Welcome to the Transcribe Notes Transcription tool. This application allows medical professionals, therapists, and other practitioners to record and transcribe consultations, as well as generate professional notes using an AI-powered note generator.<br><br>

<strong>How to Use the Functions:</strong><br><br>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Recording:</strong> The patient’s consent must always be obtained before recording. Select desired transcription model from pulldown menu, then click “Start recording” to begin capturing audio.<br><br>
  
  <strong><u>Important:</u> The recording function does not work in all browsers. We therefore recommend using <strong>Google Chrome</strong> or <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong>.</strong></li><br>

  <li><strong>Pause and resume:</strong> You can use the “Pause” button to temporarily stop the recording, for example if the consultation is interrupted or you need to leave the office for a moment. When you press “Pause,” the current audio segment is uploaded and transcribed, and the recording is paused. When you are ready to continue, click “Resume,” and the recording will automatically continue with the next segment. The timer continues from where it left off, and the recording can ultimately be ended as usual with “Stop/Done.”</li><br>

  <li><strong>Completion:</strong> When you click “Stop/Done,” the recording stops. The completion timer counts the time until the full transcription has been received (usually within 5–10 seconds).</li><br>

  <li><strong>Custom prompt and prompt profiles:</strong> On the right side, choose a prompt slot (1–10) and enter your own prompt. The prompts are saved automatically on this device. To make the prompts independent of changes to the API key, you can set a <strong>Prompt profile ID</strong> (e.g., “David”, “David 1”, “Office-PC-2”). The active profile is shown above the prompt field. If no profile is set, the prompts may still be saved using the older method that was tied to the API key.</li><br>

  <li><strong>Export / import (move or share prompts):</strong> Click <strong>Export</strong> to download a small JSON file containing all 10 prompt slots for the current profile. On another PC, set the Prompt profile ID (the same one or a new one) and click <strong>Import</strong> to load the file. Import always places the prompts into the <strong>active</strong> profile on that device, which also makes it easy to share prompt “templates” with colleagues.</li><br>

  <li><strong>Switch profile:</strong> When you change the Prompt profile ID, the prompt slots will immediately show the prompts stored under that profile. This allows multiple people to use the same PC without mixing prompts, as long as each user has their own profile.</li><br>

  <li><strong>Note generation:</strong> Once the transcription is complete, click “Generate note” to create a note based on the transcription and the selected/custom prompt. Note generation is performed by the provider selected in the dropdown menu in the note generation module. Generated clinical notes must be reviewed and validated by healthcare personnel before use.</li><br>

  <li><strong>Cost overview:</strong> To see your current cost/usage for the different providers, click the cost overview link located at the top right of the main functions page.</li><br>

  <li><strong>Security:</strong> Your audio recording is sent directly to the selected provider’s servers (from the dropdown menu) for transcription, and is neither stored (applies only to AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex, and Soniox) nor used for machine learning. The transcribed text is only displayed in your browser and is deleted/disappears as soon as you close the browser or load new content.</li><br>

  <li><strong>Guide button:</strong> Click the “Guide” button again to return to the main view.</li>
</ul><br><br>

<strong>Prompt Examples:</strong><br><br>

<strong>Consultation:</strong><br>
"System prompt – Medical Note Generator

Write a medically accurate, journal-ready note based on a transcribed doctor-patient conversation. Use the following structure (unless otherwise specified in the dictation):
Background (only if relevant history), Presenting complaint/anamnesis, Examination (bullet points), Assessment, Plan.

Rules:
– Do not include information, investigations, or findings not explicitly mentioned.
– Negative findings only if stated.
– Blood tests: write “relevant blood tests are ordered”, do not list them.
– Correct obvious misspellings in medication names.
– Do not use special characters or line breaks before headings.
– Follow explicit instructions from the doctor regarding style, length, or specific wording.

If the doctor adds comments after the patient has left, these must be considered. The note should be well-written."

<br><br>

<strong>Letter to patient:</strong><br>
"Write a letter from the doctor to the patient. Start with Hi \\"name\\", and end with<br>
Regards<br>
\\"Your name\\"<br>
\\"Clinic name\\"<br>
The letter must have a professional and formal tone. You may improve the wording slightly for better flow."

<br><br>

These are examples that work well, but feel free to adapt them to your documentation style, specialty, and type of consultation. You can also create entirely custom prompts for any purpose you wish.
